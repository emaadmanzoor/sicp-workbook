SICP Workbook
=============

This repository contains Clojure code for the
non-trivial exercises and examples in the computer
science classic [Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html),
 Abelson, Sussman and Sussman, MIT Press (1996).

## Contents

### Exercises

   1. **cube-root.clj**: Solution for exercise 1.8, finding the cube
                         root of a number using Newton's method.
   2. **recursive-add.clj**: Iterative and recursive procedures for adding two numbers,
                             noted on Exercise 1.9.
   3. **recursive-iterative-exercise**: Solution for exercise 1.11, writing
                                        an iterative procedure for a recursive function.
   4. **count-change.clj**: Code for the counting change example.

      Solutions to exercises 1.1 to 1.8 in Scheme.

      more theoretical exercises' solutions, and marvel at the comprehensive narratives put forth.
